To develop your AI chess engine project using the existing `main.py`, `constants.py`, and `additions.py` files, you can follow these steps:

### 1. **Understand the Current Codebase**
   - Familiarize yourself with the existing code in `main.py` and `constants.py`. Understand how the game loop works, how pieces are drawn, and how user input is handled.
   - Review the functions that check valid moves for each piece and how the game state is managed.

### 2. **Define AI Logic**
   - **Choose an AI Algorithm**: Decide on the algorithm you want to implement for your AI. Common choices include:
     - Minimax Algorithm: A recursive algorithm that evaluates possible moves and chooses the best one.
     - Alpha-Beta Pruning: An optimization technique for the minimax algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated.
     - Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS): A probabilistic approach that explores possible moves based on random simulations.
   - **Evaluate Board States**: Create a function to evaluate the board state. This function should return a score based on the material balance, piece positions, and other strategic factors.

### 3. **Integrate AI into the Game Loop**
   - Modify the game loop in `main.py` to allow the AI to make moves. You can check if it's the AI's turn and then call the AI function to determine the best move.
   - Ensure that the AI's move is executed in the same way as a player's move, updating the game state accordingly.

### 4. **Add AI Player Option**
   - Modify the game setup to allow players to choose between playing against another human or against the AI.
   - You can add a simple menu or toggle to switch between player vs. player and player vs. AI modes.

### 5. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Test the AI against itself and against human players to ensure it behaves as expected.
   - Debug any issues that arise, especially with move validation and game state management.

### 6. **Enhance AI Difficulty**
   - Start with a basic AI that makes random legal moves, then gradually improve it by implementing the chosen algorithm.
   - Adjust the evaluation function to make the AI more challenging by considering more strategic factors.

### 7. **User Interface Improvements**
   - Consider adding visual indicators for the AI's moves, such as highlighting the selected piece and its destination.
   - You might also want to display the AI's thinking time or the score of the current board state.

### 8. **Documentation and Comments**
   - Document your code and add comments to explain the AI logic and any new functions you create.
   - This will help you and others understand the code in the future.

### 9. **Future Enhancements**
   - Once the basic AI is working, consider adding more advanced features, such as:
     - Different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard).
     - Opening book strategies.
     - Endgame tablebases for perfect play in endgame scenarios.

### 10. **Seek Feedback**
   - Share your project with others to get feedback on the AI's performance and the overall user experience.
   - Use this feedback to make further improvements.

By following these steps, you can effectively develop and enhance your AI chess engine project. Good luck!
